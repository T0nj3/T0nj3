# Hi, I'm Tonje Albertin Kristiansen

I’m a **front-end developer**, graduated from **Noroff in December 2025**.  
I build modern, responsive, and maintainable user interfaces with a strong focus on structure, usability, and clean code.

My main tools include **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind**, and I enjoy working with component-based architectures, API-driven applications, and design systems. I value clarity in both code and UI, and aim to create solutions that are easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
